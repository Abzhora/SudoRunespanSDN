SudoRunespan by Deprecated for the RSBot botting client.

To add this script to RSBot:

1) SDN
  Add it to your SDN list from http://www.powerbot.org/scripts/

2) Precompiled class files
  You can find the latest build of the class files in the downloads section.
  Just download and decompress the archive onto your computer, then copy and paste
  the "org" folder into your RSBot "bin" folder.  Run RSBot with the -dev flag
  and it should appear in the script loader.

3) Source files
  If you have an IDE it may just be easier to pull my project into your IDE.
  Make sure to have the latest RSBot as a library and set up the program
  arguments with the -dev flag.  SudoRunespan should show up in the script loader.
